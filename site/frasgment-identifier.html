<h3>(#section1) <i>HTML definition</i></h3>
<p>HTML stands for hypertext markup language. It is also used by web designers to create websites.
Hypertext refers to text that includes links. Readers can easily navigate to other sections or pages using hypertext. Markup language, on the other hand, uses tags or plain text to identify sections of pages, such as headers, footers and tables, and also includes specific markers such as pictures and tables.

 <h3>(#section2) <i> How Does HTML Work?</i></h3>
 <p>The website author creates an HTML document. This HTML document is saved with extension.html (filename.html) or filename.htm. This file is then uploaded to the World Wide Web. It will show you how it looks online.
To open an HTML file on your computer, first open the file explorer. Next, right-click the file and select the option “Open with”. This will allow you to launch it in your favorite browser. Google Chrome, Safari and Mozilla Firefox can recognize and open the HTML file. You can also open your browser by pressing Ctrl+O and double-clicking the html file.</p>

<h3>(#section5)<i> Web Pages Development</i></h3>
<p>HTML is widely used to create pages on the internet. HTML tags are present on every page. These HTML tags include hyperlinks. They allow users to navigate to other pages. We can also say that these hyperlinks are used to link the pages. Every page we see online is written in HTML code.</p>

<h3>(#section6) <i>Internet Navigation</i> </h3>
<p>It is an important use of HTML. This navigation is made possible by the hypertext concept. It is basically the text that links with other text or web pages. When the user clicks on the link, he/she is taken to the website or text being referred. HTML can be used to embed hyperlinks within web pages. You can navigate between websites and web pages that are hosted on different servers.</p>

<h3>(#section7) <i>Cutting Edge Feature</i></h3>
<p><b>HTML5</b> with its standards, API and other features is being used to introduce some of the latest innovations in website creation. Old browsers also support polyfill libraries.
A browser such as Google Chrome is a great choice for integrating HTML5’s latest set of standards and APIs. Modernizr, a JavaScript package, can identify properties that enable the developer to load dynamically polyfill libraries.</p>
